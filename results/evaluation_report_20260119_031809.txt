RECOMMENDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
❌ POOR: Top-1 accuracy < 15%. Model needs significant improvement.
   Recommendations:
   1. Collect more training data (especially for low-accuracy brands)
   2. Train for more epochs (50-100)
   3. Check for label quality issues
   4. Consider using a larger model
